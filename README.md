# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as positive or negative. It leverages natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset used for this project is a collection of tweets labeled as positive or negative.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Tweets are cleaned by removing punctuation, stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Text data is transformed into numerical features using techniques like CountVectorization or TF-IDF.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** A suitable machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines, is selected and trained on the prepared data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
